# Operating Systems Project
For this module, I am required to	write	a	Multi-threaded TCP Server	Application	which	allows multiple	customers to	
update their bank	accounts and send	payments to	other	bank accounts.

1. Register with the	system.
* Name
* Address
* Bank	A/C	Number
* Username	
* Password
2. Log-in	to	the	banking system	from the	client	application	to the	server	application.
3. Change	customer	details.
4. Make	Lodgements	to	their	Bank	Account.
5. Make	Withdrawal	from	their	Bank	Account	(Note:	Each	User	has	a	credit	limit	of	â‚¬1000).
6. View	the	last	ten	transactions	on	their	bank	account.
